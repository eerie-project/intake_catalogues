      title: IFS 4.4km simulation (RCBMF), original IFS variables
      summary: |
        Atmosphere-only simulation at 4.4 km resolution, with reduced cloud base mass flux. Run for 1 year and 2 months, starting in 2020.

        **General**:
          * The Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), developed at ECMWF, is a spectral-transform atmospheric model with two-time-level semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian time stepping (Temperton et al., 2001; Hortal, 2002; Diamantakis and Váňa, 2021). It is here running in atmosphere-only mode, that is without an ocean model. It is still coupled to the interactive land and ocean wave models.
          * This simulation is at 4.4km in atmosphere-only mode, with SST and sea ice concentration being provided by ESA CCI v3.0.1.

        **Simulation**:
          * This is one of two new atmosphere-only IFS simulations. This one is at 4.4 km resolution, with the other one (ifs_tco3999_rcbmf) is at 2.8 km. The simulations are started on 01.01.2020 and run for 14 months, ending on 01.03.2021. The two simulations differ only in their resolution, and in slight differences in output treatment and availability. Both simulations use "reduced cloud base mass flux" (RCBMF) which has the shallow convection scheme fully active and the deep convection scheme weakly active (with a strongly reduced cloud base mass flux), in agreement with 9 km nextGEMS production simulations.
          * The simulation has the same physics as the coupled nextGEMS production simulations.
          * The simulation is closely aligned with the EERIE project and the AMIP simulations done there (1980-2023, 1 member at 9 km and 10 members at 28 km). Those runs use "deep-on" convection, not "RCBMF". A 6-month twin simulation at 4.4 km [exists](https://discover.dkrz.de/external/stac2.cloud.dkrz.de/fastapi/collections/eerie-eerie-ecmf-ifs-amip-tco2559-hist-v20240901) with "deep-on" settings.

        **Processing**:
          * This dataset uses default IFS naming of variables. Please refer to the [parameter database](https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/) for more information on the available variables.
          * Output is written to HEALPix H1024 (zoom level 10, about 6 km resolution), and to H128 (level 7, about 50 km resolution). The remapping to healpix was done with linear interpolation (different to ifs_tco3999_rcbmf and the coupled tco3999 runs, which use conservative interpolation for H128 2D variables). Output is available hourly (PT1H), daily means (P1D) and monthly means (P1M). Daily and monthly means also include some min/max fields, these are compute on the model timestep. PT1H includes instantaneous fields (valid at the given timestep) and accumulated fields (fluxes, e.g. precipitation) accumulated over the 1-hour interval *preceding* the given timestep (precipitation at 12:00 has been accumulated between 11:00 and 12:00). Daily and monthly means have a timestep at the center of the time interval (e.g. daily means are written at 12:00).
