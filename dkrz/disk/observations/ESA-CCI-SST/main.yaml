      Rewritten sst_cci data with blosc filter and kerchunked to a complete time series.
      This v2.1 SST_cci Level 4 Analysis Climate Data Record (CDR) provides a globally-complete daily analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) on a 0.05 degree regular latitude - longitude grid.
      It combines data from both the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR ) and Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) SST_cci Climate Data Records, using a data assimilation method to provide SSTs where there were no measurements.
      These data cover the period between 09/1981 and 12/2016.
      The dataset has been produced as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Sea Surface Temperature project(ESA SST_cci). The data products from SST_cci accurately map the surface temperature of the global oceans over the period 1981 to 2016 using observations from many satellites.
      The data provide independently quantified SSTs to a quality suitable for climate research.
      The CDR Version 2.1 product supercedes the CDR Version 2.0 product. Data are made freely and openly available under a Creative Commons License by Attribution (CC By 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
